Sabri's Portfolio
This is a simple portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website consists of two pages: the homepage and the about page.


## Description

The homepage displays a navigation bar with a link to the about page.
The homepage also displays a form with a button to get a joke from an external API.
When the form is submitted, an external API request is made and the joke is displayed on the page.
The about page displays some information about the portfolio owner and a contact form.
When the contact form is submitted, the data is validated, and if it's valid, it's displayed in the console.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:   `git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME}/portfolio.git`

2. Open the index.html and about.html files in your web browser to view the website.
3. To make API requests, you may need to install the node-fetch package by running the following command: `npm install node-fetch`
4. To validate the contact form, you may need to install the validator package by running the following command:  `npm install validator`




## Usage

1. To get a joke, go to the homepage and click on the "Get a Joke" button. The joke will be displayed on the page.
2. To submit the contact form, go to the about page and fill out the form with your name, email, and message. Then click the "Submit" button. If the form data is valid, it will be displayed in the console.
